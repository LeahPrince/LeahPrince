### Hi, my name is Leah Prince! 
I am a *Data Visualization Engineer*, with a focus on gaining insights through data. 
#### My Goals

:dizzy: I am an aspiring *Principal Data Visualization Engineer*. 
>I love the mystery behind discovering new findings, storytelling with data, using data to help make decisions and predicting outcomes based 
>on what has already happened. 
I have worked on various data science projects through college coursework. I've also recently graduated from a data science bootcamp.
I have been coding in Python for two years and I'm looking to improve those skills by collaborating with like-minded people.

#### Current Projects
>I am currently working an NLP project. More details to come soon.
